## Operational overview

- After clicking the start button, the player has 30s to click on as many moles that appear. Background music plays while the game is running. 
- The moles will randomly appear in one of the 9 squares. Only one mole appears at a time and only for 0.4 to 1.2 seconds.
- One successful click on a mole makes a distinct sound and adds one point to the players score.
- When a player gets a greater score than the previous highest score, it becomes the new highscore.
- The score, highscore, start button and timer can be found at the bottom of the game window.
- The moon/sun icon at the top right of the window is used to toggle between the light and dark mode of the game window.
